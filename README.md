# Unruggable

Unruggable is a cross-platform Solana Wallet App written in Go, designed to bring advanced cryptographic security and portfolio management to both desktop and mobile platforms. With features like Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Distributed Key Generation (DKG), and automated portfolio management, Unruggable aims to provide a powerful and secure experience for crypto enthusiasts.

### Key Features
